## Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
The Crop Yield Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts agricultural crop yields based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, crop type, and agricultural practices. This project utilizes historical data to train models that can help farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions to optimize crop production.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required packages. Below are the steps to set up the project.

Clone the repository:

## bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-yield-prediction.git
cd crop-yield-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

## bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

## bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start the application (change to the appropriate script name if necessary):

bash

python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required parameters for crop yield prediction.

View the predicted yields along with an analysis of the influencing factors.

Data
The dataset used for training the machine learning models comes from various agricultural databases and research sources. It includes features such as:

Historical yield data
Climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity)
Soil properties (pH, nitrogen content, organic matter)
Crop management practices (irrigation, fertilization)
You can find sample datasets in the data/ directory. For more comprehensive datasets, please refer to the provided sources in the repository.

Machine Learning Models
This project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:

## Linear Regression
## Decision Trees
## Random Forests
##Gradient Boosting
## Neural Networks
Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
